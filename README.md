# The Weather Application

- Repository: `weather-app`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `2 days`
- Deployment strategy: `Github pages / Netlify`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api

## The Mission

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.  
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

### Specifications

#### 🌱 Must haves

- In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly

> 💡 Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

#### 🌼 Nice to haves (in no specific order)

- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
- Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.

### Instructions

- Create an account on [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/.), and generate a key
- Get the weather data using the native JS [`fetch()`](https://devdocs.io/dom/fetch_api/using_fetch) method (if you like, you can also check out [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios))

## _“When the ass begins to bray, surely rain will come that day.”_ (Good luck!)
